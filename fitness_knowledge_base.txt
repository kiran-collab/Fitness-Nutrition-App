### Nutrition Guidelines

A balanced diet includes macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, along with micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals.

Protein intake should be about 1.6–2.2 grams per kg of body weight for individuals involved in resistance training.

Post-workout meals should ideally contain a mix of protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates, such as a protein shake with a banana or chicken and rice.

Hydration is crucial for metabolic function. Adults should consume around 2–3 liters of water per day depending on activity level.

Fiber intake should be about 25–30 grams daily. Good sources include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.

Meal timing can influence energy levels. Eating every 3–4 hours helps maintain blood sugar and prevent muscle catabolism.

### Fat Loss & Muscle Gain

For fat loss, a calorie deficit of 500 kcal/day is recommended, usually achieved through diet and light exercise.

For muscle gain (bulking), aim for a calorie surplus of 250–500 kcal/day, combined with progressive resistance training.

Intermittent fasting may help some users improve insulin sensitivity and reduce calorie intake.

Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) is a well-studied supplement for strength and lean mass gain.

### Fitness Workouts

Progressive overload is key for muscle growth: gradually increase weight or reps over time.

A beginner's workout split might include:
- Day 1: Upper Body (Push)
- Day 2: Lower Body
- Day 3: Rest or Cardio
- Day 4: Upper Body (Pull)
- Day 5: Full Body or HIIT

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) improves cardiovascular endurance and burns fat efficiently.

Warm-up routines reduce injury risk and improve performance; 5–10 minutes of dynamic stretching is recommended.

Mobility training (e.g., foam rolling, yoga) should be done 2–3 times per week to support recovery and joint health.

### Supplement Recommendations

Vitamin D3 is often deficient; 1000–2000 IU/day may be needed depending on blood levels.

Whey protein is convenient and effective for meeting protein needs post-exercise.

Omega-3 fatty acids support heart and brain health; aim for 1–2 grams EPA+DHA daily.

Caffeine can boost performance and focus; ideal dose is 3–6 mg/kg body weight, taken ~30 minutes pre-workout.

### Recovery & Sleep

Sleep is critical for muscle recovery and hormone regulation. Aim for 7–9 hours per night.

Post-exercise recovery can be enhanced by stretching, rehydration, protein intake, and low-intensity movement the next day.

Overtraining symptoms include persistent fatigue, mood changes, and performance plateaus—indicating need for rest.

### FAQs

Q: What's the best time to work out?
A: The best time is when you can consistently train. Morning workouts may improve adherence; evening sessions can offer strength gains.

Q: Is spot reduction of fat possible?
A: No. Fat loss occurs systemically through a calorie deficit.

Q: Are cheat meals okay?
A: Occasionally yes, as part of a balanced diet. They can support adherence if not overused.
